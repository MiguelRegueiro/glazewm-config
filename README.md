# GlazeWM Configuration 🚀

This repo contains my configuration file for **GlazeWM**, a window manager for Windows.

### Features ✨

- **Custom Colors** 🎨: Includes a palette for window borders, with colors for focused (`#8c49ff`) ![#8c49ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8c49ff/000000?text=+) and unfocused (`#000000`) ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/ffffff?text=+) windows.
- **Window Management** 🖼️: Manage gaps between windows and screen edges, with customized inner (`2px`) and outer (`12px`) gaps. Fullscreen mode is disabled, and Zebar has been removed from the configuration.
- **Keybindings** ⌨️: Navigate, move, and resize windows with ease.

### Usage 🛠️

1. **Backup the Original Config File**: Make a copy of the original `config.yaml` in your GlazeWM configuration directory to keep as a backup.
2. **Replace the Config File**: Copy my `config.yaml` into your GlazeWM configuration directory, replacing the default configuration file.
3. **Restart GlazeWM** to apply the new settings.

Feel free to modify the configuration to make it your own! 😊
