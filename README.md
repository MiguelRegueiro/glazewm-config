# GlazeWM Configuration 🚀

This repo contains my configuration file for **GlazeWM**, a window manager for Windows.

### Features ✨

- **Custom Colors** 🎨: Includes a palette with colors like `rosewater`, `mauve`, `teal`, etc.
- **Window Management** 🖼️: Manage gaps, focused window styles, and more. Fullscreen mode is disabled.
- **Keybindings** ⌨️: Navigate, move, and resize windows with ease.

### Usage 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MiguelRegueiro/glazewm-config.git
   ```
2. **Replace the Default Config File**:
   Copy my `config.yaml` and replace the default configuration file in your GlazeWM configuration directory.
3. **Restart GlazeWM** to apply the new settings.
